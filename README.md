## Data pre processing
Run ```python import_timit.py --timit=./TIMIT --preprocessed=False```
to compute the features and store them in a folder.
This script also converts the [NIST "SPHERE" file format](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/speech/software/tutorials/production/fundamentals/v1.0/section_02/s02_01_p04.html) to [WAVE PCM format](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/).
If you have already converted the files, set ```--preprocessed=True``` to skip the conversion process.

## This repo contains
- [x] Code to read files and compute MFCC features
- [x] Computing MFCC for time slices given in .PHN files
- [x] Dumping computed features to a folder
- [x] Dumping phone-wise features to a folder
- [x] GMM training
- [x] GMM model dumping
- [x] GMM evaluation
- [x] PER computation

## Expected:
    - Implement and run train.py and test.py
    - Please feel free to modify any part of the code to implement the solution
    
    Download the TIMIT dataset and extract it to your project directory
    Run the script import_timit.py
    Verify that in your TIMIT folders, for every "WAV" file there is another "_rif.wav" created - This is the file that we will be reading in our script
    import_timit.py creates "hdf" file with features and labels
    Write your GMM parameter estimation script in train.py - This covers all the objectives of the assignment (For example: Different GMM mixtures - 2,4,8 etc and finding the best mixture)
    Repeat the process for different MFCC features as mentioned in the objective (mfcc, delta, delta-delta, with/without energy coefficients)
    train.py saves the GMM models parameters in the models directory
    test.py reads the GMM model from the directory and tests it on the test data
